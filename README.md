The assignment consists of two problems, the first one involving creation of the *isocontour extraction* algorithm from a 2D scalar data of the Hurricane based on the `isovalue` provided by the user and storing it as `isocontour.vtp` polydata object in the same folder. The second problem involves rendering a 3D scalar field of the Hurricane using a custom *transfer function*, *opactiy* and optional *Phong Illumination* with the specified parameters.
