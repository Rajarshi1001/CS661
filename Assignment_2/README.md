## CS661 Assignment 2

The 3D Data used for this assignment is placed under the **\Data** folder.

The given code essentially creates a isosurface plot and histogram side by side which gets automatically updated based on a slider widget which takes all values ranging from minimum isovalues to maximum isovalues from the given 3D dataset. A `Reset` functionality is added which on clicking automatically resets the slider value, isosurface plot and histogram respectively. The number of bins used in the histogram plot is 50. 

While running the cell for displaying the interface, on clicking `Reset` button, it takes a bit of time to return to its initial configuration. 


> In order to run the code, open the `soln.ipynb` file and run the cells.
